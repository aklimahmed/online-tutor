        <p>
          Graduated with a Masters in Mathematics with First-class Honours from
          the University of Bath. I am passionate about mathematics, love
          problem solving, and believe that it has strength because of the large
          variety of disciplines encompassed within it. For my Masters
          dissertation, I wrote a research paper on the topic of Probability

        <p>
          Each session will ensure that my tutee understands what they are
          supposed to do when they see a similar question appear on an exam. I
          will strive to make my sessions as interactive as possible by asking
          relevant questions regarding the topic. Outside of the classroom, I am
          happy to set questions for homework, and mark them in my own time! For
          my setup, I use a Huion HS610 graphics tablet instead of a mouse, a
          Blue Snowball iCE microphone with pop filter and windscreen, VT-H88
          headphones...
